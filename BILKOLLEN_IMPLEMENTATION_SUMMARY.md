# Bilkollen Implementation Summary

## Overview

The "Bilkollen" (Vehicle Tracking) feature has been **fully implemented** and is ready for testing. This feature allows organizations to manage vehicle cases through their complete workflow lifecycle, from intake to completion.

---

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Data Layer (Server Actions)
**File**: [`lib/actions/vehicle.ts`](lib/actions/vehicle.ts)

Implemented complete CRUD operations and business logic:
- ✅ `getVehicleCases` - Fetch cases with filters (ongoing/archived)
- ✅ `getOrgLocations` - Fetch organization locations
- ✅ `getOrgMembers` - Fetch members for handler assignment
- ✅ `createVehicleCase` - Create new case with default location
- ✅ `updateVehicleCase` - Update case fields with audit logging
- ✅ `markVehicleCaseKlar` - Complete case with validation
- ✅ `getVehicleCaseAudits` - Fetch change history
- ✅ `getVehicleCaseAnalytics` - Fetch milestone analytics

### Phase 2: UI Components
**Directory**: [`components/vehicle-cases/`](components/vehicle-cases/)

Created all necessary UI components:

1. **[`columns.tsx`](components/vehicle-cases/columns.tsx)** - Table column definitions
   - Registration number (read-only, immutable)
   - Dropoff location (editable select)
   - Funding source (editable: insurance/internal/customer)
   - Photo inspection (checkbox)
   - Insurance status (editable: pending/approved/rejected)
   - Handler (user select or free text)
   - Actions (Mark Klar / View Details)

2. **[`vehicle-cases-table.tsx`](components/vehicle-cases/vehicle-cases-table.tsx)** - Main table component
   - Sorting, pagination
   - Inline editing
   - Empty states

3. **[`vehicle-cases-toolbar.tsx`](components/vehicle-cases/vehicle-cases-toolbar.tsx)** - Search and filters
   - Search by registration number
   - Filter by funding source, insurance status, location
   - Add vehicle button
   - Clear filters

4. **[`add-vehicle-dialog.tsx`](components/vehicle-cases/add-vehicle-dialog.tsx)** - Dialog to create new case
   - Single input for registration number
   - Auto-uppercase validation
   - Error handling

5. **[`mark-klar-dialog.tsx`](components/vehicle-cases/mark-klar-dialog.tsx)** - Completion confirmation
   - Validation checks (photo done, insurance approved)
   - Warning display for blockers
   - Conditional proceed button

6. **[`vehicle-case-drawer.tsx`](components/vehicle-cases/vehicle-case-drawer.tsx)** - Archive details drawer
   - Case summary
   - Milestone timeline (insurance approved, photo done, klar)
   - Complete audit log with formatted changes
   - User attribution

7. **[`empty-state.tsx`](components/vehicle-cases/empty-state.tsx)** - Empty state component
   - No vehicles
   - No results (after filtering)
   - No locations configured

### Phase 3: Main Page & Navigation
**File**: [`app/(authenticated)/org/[orgId]/bilkollen/page.tsx`](app/(authenticated)/org/[orgId]/bilkollen/page.tsx)

Created full-featured page with:
- ✅ Two-tab interface (Pågående / Arkiv)
- ✅ Search and filter state management
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates
- ✅ Error handling with toast notifications
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Empty states for different scenarios
- ✅ Dialog and drawer management

**Navigation**: Updated [`components/AppSidebar.tsx`](components/AppSidebar.tsx)
- Added "Bilkollen" menu item with Car icon
- Implemented org-scoped URL transformation
- Positioned after "Översikt", before "Ny Rapport"

### Phase 4: Business Logic

All workflows properly implemented:

1. **Edit Workflow**
   - Optimistic updates for instant feedback
   - Server-side validation
   - Audit log creation on every change
   - Rollback on error

2. **Klar (Complete) Workflow**
   - Validation: Photo inspection must be done
   - Validation: Insurance approved OR funding is internal
   - Warning display if validation fails
   - Automatic archiving with timestamp and user attribution

3. **Create Case Workflow**
   - Auto-fetch default location
   - Registration number trimming and uppercase
   - Default values (insurance pending, photo not done, not klar)
   - User attribution (created_by, updated_by)

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Every field change logged
   - Old/new value tracking
   - Full snapshot capture
   - User attribution with timestamps

### Phase 5: UI/UX Polish

- ✅ Badge styling for status indicators
- ✅ Loading skeletons
- ✅ Empty states with contextual CTAs
- ✅ Toast notifications for feedback
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Keyboard-friendly forms

## Backend Integration

The feature integrates with existing Supabase backend:

### Tables Used
- `org_locations` - Organization dropoff locations
- `vehicle_cases` - Main vehicle tracking table
- `vehicle_case_audits` - Change history (append-only)
- `vehicle_cases_view` - Denormalized view for UI
- `vehicle_case_status_summary` - Materialized view for analytics

### RLS Policies
- ✅ All tables protected by Row Level Security
- ✅ Users can only access their organization's data
- ✅ Hard delete blocked on cases and audits

### Triggers
- ✅ `created_by`, `updated_by`, `updated_at` auto-managed
- ✅ Registration number forced uppercase and trimmed
- ✅ Registration number immutable after creation

### Cron Jobs
- ✅ Analytics materialized view refreshes every 15 minutes

## Testing Checklist

### Prerequisites
1. [ ] Create at least one `org_location` with `is_default = true`
2. [ ] Ensure Next.js dev server is running
3. [ ] User is authenticated and member of an organization

### Manual Testing

#### Creating Vehicles
- [ ] Click "Lägg till bil"
- [ ] Enter registration number (e.g., "ABC123")
- [ ] Verify it's added to Pågående tab
- [ ] Verify it appears in uppercase
- [ ] Verify default location is set

#### Editing Cases
- [ ] Change dropoff location via dropdown
- [ ] Change funding source (insurance/internal/customer)
- [ ] Toggle photo inspection checkbox
- [ ] Change insurance status (pending/approved/rejected)
- [ ] Assign handler from dropdown
- [ ] Verify each change shows toast notification

#### Marking as Klar
- [ ] Try marking vehicle klar without photo done → should show warning
- [ ] Try marking vehicle klar without insurance approved (when not internal) → should show warning
- [ ] Mark photo done
- [ ] Approve insurance
- [ ] Mark vehicle klar → should succeed and move to Arkiv

#### Archive View
- [ ] Switch to Arkiv tab
- [ ] Click "Visa detaljer" on archived case
- [ ] Verify drawer opens with summary
- [ ] Verify milestones show correct timestamps
- [ ] Verify audit log shows all changes
- [ ] Verify "Tid till klar" shows correct days

#### Search & Filters
- [ ] Search by registration number
- [ ] Filter by funding source
- [ ] Filter by insurance status
- [ ] Filter by location
- [ ] Combine multiple filters
- [ ] Verify "Rensa filter" clears all filters
- [ ] Verify empty state shows "No results" when filtering

#### Empty States
- [ ] With no vehicles: Shows "Inga fordon ännu" with "Lägg till fordon" button
- [ ] With filters but no results: Shows "Inga resultat hittades" with "Rensa filter" button
- [ ] With no locations: Shows "Inga platser konfigurerade" message

#### Pagination
- [ ] Add 15+ vehicles
- [ ] Change page size (10/25/50/100)
- [ ] Navigate between pages
- [ ] Verify counts are correct

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Try editing registration number → should be read-only
- [ ] Create vehicle with same reg number as existing → should allow
- [ ] Create vehicle without locations → should show error
- [ ] Mark klar multiple times → should work once, then be in archive

## Next Steps

1. **Set Up Locations**
   - Run SQL to create `org_locations` for your organization
   - See [`BILKOLLEN_SETUP.md`](BILKOLLEN_SETUP.md) for instructions

2. **Test the Feature**
   - Follow the testing checklist above
   - Report any issues

3. **Optional Enhancements** (Future)
   - Add ability to toggle between user assignment and free text for handler
   - Add bulk operations (mark multiple as klar)
   - Add export functionality (CSV/Excel)
   - Add analytics dashboard for vehicle throughput
   - Add email notifications for status changes

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Handler Field**: Currently only supports user dropdown. Free text input is in the data model but not yet implemented in UI (can be added later).

2. **Locations**: Must be created via SQL. No UI for location management yet (can be added to Hantering section).

3. **Analytics Refresh**: Materialized view refreshes every 15 minutes via cron. Real-time analytics would require different approach.
